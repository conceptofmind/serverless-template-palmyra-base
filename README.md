# Model Description
Palmyra Base was primarily pre-trained with English text. Note that there is still a trace amount of non-English data present within the training corpus that was accessed through CommonCrawl. A causal language modeling (CLM) objective was utilized during the process of the model's pretraining. Similar to GPT-3, Palmyra Base is a member of the same family of models that only contain a decoder. As a result, it was pre-trained utilizing the objective of self-supervised causal language modeling. Palmyra Base uses the prompts and general experimental setup from GPT-3 in order to conduct its evaluation per GPT-3.

# Use case
Palmyra Base is extremely powerful while being extremely fast. This model excels at many nuanced tasks such as sentiment classification and summarization.

# Training data
Palmyra Base (5b) was trained on Writer‚Äôs custom dataset.
